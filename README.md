# Python-Portfolio-Project
This dataset is sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-predication). 


A given dataset contains loan application information. Analyse these dataset to assist lender to explore, visualise and automate the loan eligibility process based on the information provided by applicants. Lastly, applying the machine learning tools to see which model would predict the applications that should be approved/rejected. 


## Columns of data 

1)Loan_Id:Unique Loan ID

2)Gender:Male/ Female

3)Married:Applicant married (Y/N)

4)Dependents:Number of dependents

5)Education:Applicant Education (Graduate/ Under Graduate)

6)Self_Employed:Self employed (Y/N)

7)ApplicantIncome:Applicant income

8)CoapplicantIncome:Co-applicant income

9)LoanAmount:Loan amount in thousands

10)Loan_Amount_Term:loan terms in months

11)Credit_History:- credit history meets policy (1= meet the policy, 2= not meet policy)

12)Property_Area:- Urban/ Semi Urban/ Rural locations

13)Loan_Status:- Loan approved (Y/N)
